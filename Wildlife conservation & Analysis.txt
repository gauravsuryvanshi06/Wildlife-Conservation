Wildlife Conservation & Analysis Using Machine Learning
• Developed a computer vision model using InceptionV3 to detect and count wildlife populations from images and videos,
achieving 97% accuracy.
• Analyzed ecological data to create species profiles, incorporating population trends and habitat information for
conservation insights
• Implemented machine learning algorithms to classify species according to IUCN Red List criteria, enhancing endangered
species classification.
• Built a Streamlit-based web application for crowdsourced data collection, enabling real-time data analysis and
visualization for conservation monitoring.
