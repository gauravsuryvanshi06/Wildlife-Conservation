Welcome to our Wildlife Conservation Web Application.
               We're using state-of-the-art technology to drive the mission of Wildlife Conservation.

 
🌿Count with Precision: Our tech doesn't just count animals; it spotlights each one uniquely. 🐾✨
Computer do the Tagging

🔍Classify, Track, Preserve: Beyond counting, this project also classifies and tracks, capturing the essence of conservation. An interface where nature and technology dance in harmony. 🌿🤖
             
             
Anyone collecting camera trap photos can upload them to Wildlife Project. Photos are stored online so you can access them from anywhere, from any device or computer, even out in the field.

Animals in your photos are automatically identified using machine learning technology. Thousands of images can be tagged within minutes, saving you time to do the important work.

    We urgently need to understand the presence and absence of species and their population trends in the areas where we work. Camera trap surveys are an effective method for doing this, but each camera trap survey produces tens of thousands of images, all of which need to be looked at. 
    but this can involve weeks or even months of painstaking effort. To speed up this process, this web application is crowd-sourcing the identifications through our Instant Wild App. Another method that has huge potential to transform our work is automated image recognition, using the power of machine learning to complete large scale species recognition within images.   
    By using the essentially limitless processing power of computers to do the hard work of identifying species within images, we can dramatically speed up the analysis of camera trap surveys and monitor wildlife trends in near real time.
